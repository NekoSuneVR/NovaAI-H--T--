## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚡ One-Line Install (fresh machine)

**Windows** — open PowerShell and paste:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cachenetworks/NovaAI/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Linux** — open a terminal and paste:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cachenetworks/NovaAI/main/install.sh | bash
```

> Both installers handle **everything** — Python, **run mode (GUI window vs browser/Web)**, LLM provider choice (Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter, LM Studio, or any custom endpoint), model downloads, NVIDIA GPU setup, and a desktop shortcut/launcher mapped to your chosen `--gui` / `--web` mode — the works. Just answer a few questions and sit back.
>
> **Run mode:** pick **GUI** (native desktop window) or **Web** (browser UI you reach from any device). Both install the base + voice + **stream-alert** dependencies; GUI also installs the desktop-GUI extra. The installer writes a `run-nova.sh` (`run-nova.bat` on Windows) and a menu/desktop shortcut that launch NovaAI in that mode — switch later by editing `.nova-run-mode`.

### 🔧 Already have the repo?

```bash
python setup.py          # or python3 on Linux
```

First run does the full setup, then launches the GUI (or the browser web UI on a
headless machine). Subsequent runs skip straight to launch.

### 📋 All commands

```bash
python setup.py              # Setup (if needed) + launch (GUI, or web UI if headless)
python setup.py --launch     # 🖥️ Launch desktop GUI
python setup.py --web        # 🌐 Launch headless browser web UI (great for a Pi/server)
python setup.py --terminal   # ⌨️ Terminal mode
python setup.py --setup      # 🔧 Re-run setup only
python setup.py --update     # 🔄 Check for updates

python app.py --web          # 🌐 Same web UI, started directly (0.0.0.0:8800)
```

## 🌐 Network Access (web mode)

In **`--web`** mode the **dashboard, avatar overlay and avatar WebSocket all share the single web port** — they're reverse-proxied behind it as paths, so **one origin** (and **one Cloudflare tunnel hostname on 443**) serves everything. The Minecraft Live View keeps its own port.

| Service | Port | Reach it at |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 🖥️ Web dashboard | `8800` | `http://<host>:8800/` |
| 🧍 Avatar overlay (page) | `8800` | `http://<host>:8800/avatar` |
| 🔌 Avatar WebSocket | `8800` | `ws(s)://<host>:8800/avatar-ws` |
| 💸 Tips / earnings overlay | `8800` | `http://<host>:8800/overlay/earnings` |
| 🎮 Minecraft Live View | `8768` | `http://<host>:8768/` (own port) |

The avatar bridge still listens internally on `8766`/`8765`, but only on **localhost** now — the web port proxies to it, so those ports never need to be exposed. Just open the dashboard at e.g. `http://192.168.1.107:8800/` (or your Tailscale IP); opening the **Avatar** window points a new tab at `…:8800/avatar` on the same host you're already using.

- ☁️ **Cloudflare tunnel (one hostname):** point a single ingress at the web port — everything (dashboard, `/avatar`, the `/avatar-ws` WebSocket, `/overlay/earnings`, `/overlay/game`) rides it. No `:8766`/`:8765`/`:5555` ports to forward; the page builds same-origin `wss://your-domain/avatar-ws` automatically:
  ```yaml
  ingress:
    - hostname: nova.example.com
      service: http://localhost:8800
    # optional: Minecraft live view on its own hostname
    - hostname: mc.example.com
      service: http://localhost:8768
    - service: http_status:404
  ```
- 🎬 **OBS Browser Sources:** avatar at `http://<host>:8800/avatar?transparent=1` (shows *only* the avatar), the tips overlay at `http://<host>:8800/overlay/earnings`, and the **chat-game board** at `http://<host>:8800/overlay/game`.
- 🖥️ The **desktop GUI** (`--gui`) is a local app, so these services stay bound to **`127.0.0.1`** (localhost only) and use their own ports directly.
- 🔒 The avatar bridge is localhost-only in web mode; `MC_VIEWER_HOST` controls the Live View's exposure (default `0.0.0.0`). Set per-service hosts to override.

> ⚠️ These services have **no authentication**, so binding to all interfaces exposes them to everyone on your LAN / tailnet. That's usually fine on a trusted network; lock them down with the host overrides above if not.

---

## 🖥️ The Desktop GUI

NovaAI runs as a native desktop window powered by **pywebview + Tailwind CSS** — a proper web-rendered UI that looks and feels modern, not some grey widget nightmare.

| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| 📊 **Dashboard** | Session controls, toggle voice/mic/hands-free/web/media (all persist across restarts), live status |
| 💬 **Chat** | Full conversation view with text + voice input |
| 🔔 **Reminders** | Time-based reminders and recurring alarms |
| 📅 **Calendar** | Events with date/time tracking |
| 🛒 **Shopping** | Checkbox shopping list |
| ✅ **To-Do** | Task list with done/delete |
| 💜 **Stream** | Connect Twitch chat, watch the live feed, set the reply mode + who can talk (everyone / subscribers / moderators) |
| 🧍 **Avatar** | Upload a VRM, open the OBS window, test emotions, toggle lip-sync |
| 💃 **MMD** | Add dances (motion + song + camera bundled per row), play on the avatar, delete |
| 🎮 **Game** | Pick a driver (Minecraft/universal/etc.), set a goal, watch the live view |
| ♠ **Chat Games** | Start Connect 4 / Minesweeper vs Twitch chat (OBS overlay), **and** host the Neuro Game SDK server to play external SDK games |
| 🎤 **Sing** | Type a song, attach/auto-find a backing track, replay saved songs |
| 👤 **Profiles** | Create, clone, switch, delete, or import/export personalities |
| ⚙️ **Settings** | Audio devices, web search, LLM/TTS/STT config |

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Voice replies, hands-free mode, and mic mute can all be toggled *before* starting a session. Configure everything first, then hit Start.

---

## 💜 Neuro-sama Mode

NovaAI can do far more than chat — it can stream, learn, embody a 3D avatar, play games, and sing. Everything below is **local-first** and tuned to run on a modest 6–8GB GPU (with cloud/CLI fallbacks where it matters).

### 💜 Twitch Chat

Reads your channel's chat and replies **in-character**, just like Neuro-sama. Works anonymously (read-only) or, with a bot token, posts replies straight back into chat.

- Reply policy: **mention** (answer when named), **command** (only `!ask ...`), or **all** (answer everything) — with a cooldown so it never spams or swamps the GPU
- **Who can talk to NovaAI**: `everyone`, `subscribers` (subs/VIPs/mods/broadcaster), or `moderators` (mods/broadcaster) — all chat still shows in the feed
- Live chat feed + connection status on the **Stream** page; replies also speak aloud (OBS-capturable) and lip-sync the avatar
- Set it up with `TWITCH_ENABLED`, `TWITCH_CHANNEL`, and (optional) `TWITCH_BOT_USERNAME` + `TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN`

### 🎉 Stream Alerts & Tips ("Stockings")

NovaAI reacts to **donations, follows, subs, resubs, gift subs, cheers, raids, and hosts** with an avatar expression + a cute, **profile-flavored** spoken message — then tallies the money on a tips overlay.

- **Sources**: Streamlabs & StreamElements (enter the tokens in **Settings → Stream Alerts** or via `STREAMLABS_SOCKET_TOKEN` / `STREAMELEMENTS_JWT_TOKEN`), or a universal **webhook** so **Twitch EventSub, Tangia, sound-alert tools, or any bot** can drive reactions:
  - **Streamlabs** uses your socket API token and covers donations plus **Twitch / YouTube / Facebook / Kick / Trovo** follows, subs, resubs, gift subs, bits, hosts, raids, and YouTube **Super Chats** (amounts normalized automatically).
  - **StreamElements** connects to the current **Astro WebSocket gateway** (`wss://astro.streamelements.com`) using your channel **JWT** — the channel id is read from the token, and it subscribes to tips + activities.
  > ⚠️ Live Streamlabs/StreamElements alerts need the streaming client — run **`pip install -r requirements-streaming.txt`** (the installers do this for you; otherwise NovaAI tells you it's missing and only the webhook/simulator work).
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://<host>:8800/webhook/stream?source=webhook" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"type":"donation","user":"Alice","amount":5,"currency":"USD"}'
  ```
  (Set `NOVA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to require an `X-Nova-Secret` header / `?secret=`.)
- **Platform filter** (Streamlabs only): Streamlabs forwards events for **every** platform linked to the account (Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Kick, Trovo…). To only react to some, set **Streamlabs platforms** in Settings (or `STREAMLABS_PLATFORMS`) to a comma list like `twitch,kick` — blank = all. Duplicate emissions are de-duped automatically.
- **Reactions** are editable per profile (`profile_details.alerts`): a cute message + expression per event type. Placeholders: `{user} {amount} {currency} {months} {tier} {viewers} {message}`.
- **Tips overlay** ("stockings"): an OBS-ready transparent page at **`/overlay/earnings`** showing all-time / today / session totals (try `?show=today`, `?title=Goal&goal=500`). Bits convert at 100 = ~$1.
- **Test** any reaction without a live event from the **Stream** page buttons.

### 🧬 Memory / Learning (RAG)

NovaAI **remembers across sessions** using retrieval-augmented memory — not fine-tuning. Tell it a fact today, ask for it next week, and it recalls it.

- Local **sentence-transformers** embeddings on CPU by default (keeps VRAM free for the LLM); Ollama or OpenAI embedding backends optional
- Stored in the same SQLite DB; thumbs-up/down reinforces or de-weights memories, and stale/low-score ones are pruned automatically
- Configure with `RAG_ENABLED`, `RAG_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, `RAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `RAG_TOP_K`

### 🧍 VRM Avatar

A real 3D avatar (three-vrm) that **lip-syncs to the voice**, changes expression with the mood, breathes/blinks on idle, and even dances.

- Upload any **`.vrm`** model from the **Avatar** page
- **20+ expressions** with matching body language — happy, excited, laugh, proud, smug, **blush, shy, love, flirty, wink**, sad, cry, pout, angry, anxious, scared, surprised, shocked, confused, relaxed, calm, sleepy, and **sleeping** (lies down with eyes closed) — plus visemes driven from live TTS amplitude
- Custom expressions like **blush / wink / love** use the model's own blendshapes when present, and gracefully fall back to a matching preset + pose otherwise
- Expressions are auto-picked from the mood of each reply, or test them from the **Avatar** page buttons
- **OBS-ready**: open the transparent browser window as a Browser Source for streaming
- Shared lip-sync seam means chat, Twitch replies, game narration, and singing **all** animate it

### 💃 MMD Dances

Play **MMD (`.vmd`) dance motions on your VRM avatar** — with optional audio and an optional camera motion.

- **Add a dance** from the dedicated **MMD** page (sidebar): each dance is one bundle — a `.vmd` **motion** (required) + an optional **song** (`.mp3`/`.wav`/`.ogg`/`.m4a`) + an optional `.vmd` **camera**, uploaded together and shown as a single row with **Play** and **Delete**. Saved under `data/mmd/sets/`.
- Pick motion + audio + camera, hit **Play Dance** (with optional **Loop**) and it retargets the MMD motion onto the VRM humanoid, syncs the audio, and (if provided) drives the camera. **Stop** returns to idle.
- Works in the OBS overlay too (`?transparent=1`).
- **Move the camera by hand** on the web view: **drag** to orbit, **scroll** to zoom, **right-drag** to pan, **double-click** to snap back to auto framing. (Grabbing the camera overrides a dance's own camera; controls are off in the fixed OBS overlay.)

> ⚙️ MMD→VRM retargeting follows the conversion used by the working [vrm-dance-viewer](https://github.com/JLChnToZ/vrm-dance-viewer) (axis mode 2: position.x and quaternion x/w negated). Torso, head, arms and hands track. A live **MMD body tuning** panel on the **non-transparent** overlay (`http://<host>:8800/avatar`) lets you flip the facing/axis (0–3), knee bend, leg-IK, arm-down and camera zoom and watch the dance update; choices save automatically.

> 🦵 **Legs:** driven by **CCD foot-IK** (the foot follows the VMD's 足ＩＫ target) with a **knee hinge** so the knee can't snap/hyper-extend — modelled on [vrm-dance-viewer](https://github.com/JLChnToZ/vrm-dance-viewer). If a model's knees bend the wrong way, flip **Knees** in the tuning panel; you can also switch **Leg IK off** to fall back to raw FK. Body, torso, head, arms, hands, legs and feet all track.

### 🎮 Game Playing

NovaAI autonomously plays games, narrating its thoughts aloud (in chat, voice, avatar, and stream) as it goes.

- **Minecraft** via a Mineflayer Node bridge: mine, build, craft, smelt, farm crops/trees with bone meal, fish, breed animals, trade villagers, fight mobs, follow/help whitelisted players, auto-equip better tools
- **Live View**: a fancy green dashboard serving the 3D world (prismarine-viewer) + live inventory + the bot's thoughts + server chat on **one port**
- **Universal driver**: a vision+input agent (set a `VISION_MODEL`) for TOS-safe single-player games; plus **Factorio** (RCON), and offline-only **osu!**
- **VRChat** (official OSC, EAC-safe): walk/strafe/run/turn/look, jump, chatbox (with typing indicator), and avatar emotes. It also **receives** avatar params (Velocity/Grounded) to notice walls + ledges, and reads VRChat's logs for the current world and **who's in the instance** (greets people by name) — no risky web API, no GPU
- Per-game settings live in the **Game** panel — no `.env` editing to switch servers. Requires Node.js 18+ and `npm install` in `node/minecraft-bridge`

### ♠ Chat Games — Twitch chat vs NovaAI

Turn-based games where **Twitch chat plays against NovaAI**, Neuro-sama style. Chat votes a move during a countdown, the most-voted legal move is played, then NovaAI answers with a real game engine and trash-talks in voice + chat. Each has a live OBS board overlay.

- **Connect 4** — vote a column (`1`-`7`); NovaAI plays alpha-beta minimax (really blocks + sets up wins).
- **Battleship** — take turns firing (vote `e5`); NovaAI hunts your fleet with a checkerboard + target AI. Sink all ships to win.
- **Minesweeper** — alternate revealing cells (vote `c4`); reveal a mine and you lose. NovaAI runs a constraint solver and only knows what's revealed, same as chat. First reveal is always safe.
- **Reversi / Othello** — vote a square (`d3`); NovaAI plays a corner-prizing positional engine. Most discs wins.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe** — vote a cell (`1`-`9`); NovaAI plays perfect minimax, so the best chat can force is a draw.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors** — best of 5; vote `rock`/`paper`/`scissors`; NovaAI reads chat's patterns and counters them.
- **Nim** — vote `heap count` (e.g. `2 3`); take the last object to win. NovaAI plays the optimal nim-sum strategy.
- **Start it** from the **Chat Games** panel, or let mods start it in chat: `!game connect4` / `!game battleship` / `!game reversi` / … / `!game stop`. Adding more games is one small module — the picker lists whatever's registered.
- **OBS overlay** at **`/overlay/game`** (transparent browser source): live board, per-column/-cell vote tally, turn + countdown — exactly like the screenshot. Connect the **Stream** (Twitch) first so chat can vote; tune the vote window, think delay, first mover, and auto-rematch in the panel.
- The engine picks the moves (always legal, genuinely strong); the **persona only does the commentary** — so NovaAI plays well *and* stays in character.

### 🖼️ Image Review — NovaAI looks and reacts

Show NovaAI an image and it actually **sees** it: open the **Chat** tab, click 🖼️, pick an image, and (optionally) ask a question. NovaAI describes what's there, **reads any text** in it, and gives an in-character opinion in chat + voice — react to art, memes, screenshots, or a picture of itself. Uses a local **Ollama vision model** (set a Vision model in Settings, e.g. `llava` / `qwen2.5vl` / `moondream`) or an **OpenAI-compatible multimodal** chat model.

### 🕹️ Neuro Game SDK — play real games

NovaAI hosts the **[Neuro Game SDK](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk)** server, so it's a drop-in replacement for "Neuro" on the AI side. **Any** game built with the SDK connects to NovaAI and NovaAI perceives the game and chooses the actions — one server unlocks every community integration:

- 🔪 [Liar's Bar](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-liarsbar) · 🔫 [Buckshot Roulette](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-buckshotroulette-reference) · 🧑‍🚀 [Among Us](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-amongus) · 🃏 [Inscryption](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-inscryption) · 🦋 [Hollow Knight](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-hollow-knight) · 🌃 [Cyberpunk](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-cyberpunk) · 🔴 [Pokémon Platinum](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-pokemon-platinum) · 💰 [Who Wants to Be a Millionaire](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-millionaire) — and anything else using the SDK.

**How it works:** the game is a WebSocket *client*; NovaAI is the *server*. Start the server from the **Chat Games** panel (it listens on `ws://<host>:8000` by default), then point the game at it by setting its `NEURO_SDK_WS_URL` environment variable to that URL and launching it. When the game asks NovaAI to act, the shared LLM engine reads the game state + the registered actions, picks one, and fills its JSON schema (validated/repaired automatically, with retries if the game rejects a move); non-silent game events get a spoken in-character reaction. Optional **proactive mode** lets NovaAI act on her own between prompts (for action games like Hollow Knight that don't wait for input). Configure the port, retries, proactive play, and whether to react aloud in the panel; override the bind address with `NOVA_NEURO_HOST` (defaults to the launch mode's host).

### 🎤 Singing

NovaAI sings songs in its **own cloned voice**, on the beat, over a real instrumental.

- Type `Artist - Title` → it fetches **timed lyrics** (LRCLIB) and performs them
- Backing track is optional: attach a **file**, paste a **YouTube URL**, or leave it blank to **auto-find an instrumental** on YouTube
- **Vocals + backing are merged into one audio file**, saved in `audio/songs/` for instant replay
- Works with **XTTS** (timed, on-beat) or **gTTS**. Needs `pip install yt-dlp imageio-ffmpeg` for the YouTube/merge features

## 🎭 Profiles — Make It Yours

Each companion profile is deeply customisable. Go wild:

| Section | What You Can Tweak |
|---------|-------------------|
| 🏷️ **Identity** | Name, pronouns, role, relationship style |
| 💬 **Conversation** | Reply length, pacing, verbosity, formatting |
| 🎚️ **Personality Sliders** | Warmth, sass, directness, patience, playfulness, formality |
| 🚧 **Boundaries** | Roast intensity, avoided topics, safety overrides |
| 🧠 **Memory** | Likes, dislikes, personal facts, inside jokes, projects |
| 🔊 **Voice** | Speech style, delivery notes, persona keywords |
| 📜 **Custom Rules** | Hard must-follow rules and soft preferences |

Want a sarcastic best friend? A patient tutor? A no-nonsense project manager? Just create a new profile and dial the sliders. 🎛️

### 📤 Import / Export

Move a profile between machines (e.g. your **PC → Raspberry Pi**) from the **Profiles** page:

- **Export** — click **Export** on any profile to download a `*.nova-profile.json` file (saved to the device you're browsing from).
- **Import** — click **Import**, pick a `*.nova-profile.json` file, and it's added as a **new** profile (importing never overwrites an existing one).
- **Delete** — remove any non-active profile with **Delete** (you always keep at least one).

> 💡 The export file carries the whole profile — identity, sliders, memory notes, voice, and all feature data — so the imported copy behaves exactly like the original.

---

## 🗄️ Data Storage

All runtime data lives in a single **SQLite database** at `data/novaai.db`:

- 💬 Chat history
- 👤 Profiles and all their feature data (reminders, todos, shopping, calendar, alarms, alert messages)
- ⚙️ App state (active profile, settings, tips/earnings totals)

Binary assets live on disk: VRM models in `data/avatars/`, MMD dances in `data/mmd/`.

> 📦 On first run, existing JSON files (`profiles.json`, `history.jsonl`) are **automatically migrated** into the database. No manual steps needed.

## 📚 Documentation

<details>
<summary>🧠 How the Chat Pipeline Works</summary>

When you send a message (text or voice), NovaAI runs through this pipeline:

1. **Media check** — is it a play/radio/music request? Handle it directly.
2. **Feature check** — is it a reminder, alarm, todo, shopping, or calendar request? Parse and handle.
3. **Web search** — if enabled, check for explicit `/web` queries, inferred lookups (*"what's the weather?"*), or auto-search triggers.
4. **Memory recall** — if RAG is enabled, retrieve relevant long-term memories and inject them as context.
5. **LLM request** — build a system prompt from the active profile, attach conversation history, web context, and recalled memories, send to the LLM.
6. **Voice output** — if voice is enabled, synthesise the reply with XTTS-v2 or gTTS, play it back, and drive the avatar's lip-sync.
7. **Remember** — store the exchange back into RAG memory for future recall.
8. **Hands-free loop** — if hands-free mode is on, immediately start listening for the next turn.

A shared generation seam (`engine.py`) means Twitch chat and the game agent reuse this exact pipeline. The whole thing runs in a background thread so the UI stays responsive.

<summary>🎙️ Voice & Audio Architecture</summary>

### Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Engine: `faster-whisper` (local) or Google Web Speech API
- Mic capture via `SpeechRecognition` library
- Automatic noise calibration on first listen
- Configurable silence detection, energy threshold, and VAD

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- **XTTS-v2** (default): local neural TTS with voice cloning, GPU-accelerated, streamed output
- **gTTS** (fallback): Google's cloud TTS — lightweight but needs internet
- Audio saved to `audio/latest_reply.wav` (XTTS) or `.mp3` (gTTS)
- Playback via `sounddevice` with configurable output device

### Audio Devices
- Mic and speaker can be pinned via `.env` or the Settings page
- `/mics` and `/speakers` commands list available devices with indices
- Recalibration re-tunes the noise gate without restarting

</details>

<details>
<summary>🗄️ Database Schema</summary>

NovaAI uses SQLite (`data/novaai.db`) with three tables:

**`profiles`** — one row per companion profile
```sql
profile_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY   -- e.g. "default", "snarky-bot"
profile_name TEXT               -- display name
data         TEXT               -- full profile JSON blob
created_at   TEXT               -- ISO timestamp
updated_at   TEXT               -- ISO timestamp
```

**`history`** — one row per chat message
```sql
id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
timestamp TEXT                -- ISO timestamp
role      TEXT                -- "user", "assistant", or "system"
content   TEXT                -- message text
```

**`app_state`** — key/value settings store
```sql
key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY        -- e.g. "active_profile_id"
value TEXT                    -- the value
```

Feature data (reminders, alarms, todos, shopping, calendar) lives inside the profile JSON blob under `profile_details`, so it's saved/loaded with the profile automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ Performance Auto-Tuning</summary>

When `AUTO_TUNE_PERFORMANCE=true`, NovaAI detects your hardware at startup and picks a performance profile:

| What It Checks | What It Adjusts |
|----------------|----------------|
| CPU core count | Request timeouts |
| Available RAM | Token budget |
| CUDA GPU presence | TTS/STT GPU acceleration |
| VRAM amount | Whisper model size, XTTS streaming settings |

**Tuning goals:**
- `speed` — smaller models, aggressive timeouts, prioritise response time
- `balanced` — sensible defaults for most hardware
- `quality` — larger models, longer timeouts, prioritise output quality

> ⚠️ Auto-tune **never** changes `XTTS_SPEED`, so your companion's voice pace stays consistent across machines.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔄 Auto-Update System</summary>

NovaAI can check for and install updates from GitHub:

1. On startup, compares local `VERSION` to the remote `VERSION` on your configured branch
2. If a newer version exists and `AUTO_UPDATE_INSTALL=true`, downloads and applies the update
3. Restarts itself with the new code

**Safety guards:**
- Git checkouts with local edits are **never** auto-updated
- Update results are cached for `AUTO_UPDATE_CACHE_SECONDS` (default: 6 hours) to avoid hammering GitHub
- Manual updates always available via `python setup.py --update`

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎵 Media & Radio</summary>

NovaAI intercepts natural media requests:

- *"play Capital FM"* → finds and streams the radio station
- *"play synthwave on SoundCloud"* → searches and plays a track
- *"pause"* / *"resume"* / *"stop"* → controls the current stream

**Supported radio regions:** UK, US, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan (with fallback to internet-radio.com search)

**Music platforms:** SoundCloud (default), with Spotify and Deezer as search options

In-app playback uses `ffplay` for radio streams and resolved audio URLs.

</details>

## 💡 Good to Know

- 📥 **First run downloads models** — XTTS-v2 and faster-whisper grab model files on first use. `python setup.py` preloads them so you're not waiting forever.
- 🔇 **Mic mute is app-level** — it stops NovaAI from listening. It doesn't touch your Windows system mic.
- 🔒 **Git-safe updates** — if NovaAI detects a git checkout with local edits, self-update is skipped to protect your work.
- 💾 **Audio is always saved** — voice replies land in `audio/latest_reply.wav` even if playback fails. Useful for debugging.
- 🌍 **Works offline** — with Ollama and XTTS, the entire pipeline runs locally. Web search is optional.

## 🐧 Linux & Raspberry Pi Support

> NovaAI runs on **Windows**, **amd64 Linux**, and **ARM64 / Raspberry Pi 5**.

### Run modes & install profiles

`install.sh` / `install.ps1` ask **how you want to run NovaAI** and install the
right dependency set for it:

| Run mode | Installs | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| **Web** | `requirements.txt` + `requirements-voice.txt` + `requirements-streaming.txt` | Browser UI reachable from any device. Great for a Pi / server. |
| **GUI** | the above **+ `requirements-gui.txt`** | The native desktop window (needs a display). |

Both modes install the **stream-alert** client (`requirements-streaming.txt`) so
live Streamlabs/StreamElements alerts work out of the box. Prefer to pick the raw
dependency set yourself? Use `NOVA_INSTALL_PROFILE` (`minimal` / `voice` / `gui` /
`full`) with `setup.py --setup`, or install manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt                            # minimal (text + web UI)
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-voice.txt  # add voice/ML
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-streaming.txt # add live stream alerts
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-gui.txt    # add the desktop GUI
```

> The desktop GUI's CEF backend is Windows-only; on Linux/ARM `requirements-gui.txt`
> uses your system WebView instead (`gir1.2-webkit2-4.1` on Debian/Ubuntu).

### 🍓 Raspberry Pi 5 / headless quick-start

A Pi (or any server) usually has no monitor, mic, or speakers — so run the **browser
web UI** and reach Nova from another device:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cachenetworks/NovaAI && cd NovaAI
python3 setup.py --setup        # choose the "Minimal" profile when asked
sudo apt install ffmpeg         # optional, for audio playback later
python3 app.py --web            # serves the UI on 0.0.0.0:8800
```

Then open `http://<pi-ip>:8800` in any browser on your network. Prefer the terminal?
`python3 app.py` gives you the same companion as a text chat over SSH.

- Host/port are configurable: `NOVA_WEB_HOST` / `NOVA_WEB_PORT` (default `0.0.0.0:8800`).
- On a box with no audio hardware, keep `VOICE_ENABLED=false` (the default) and set
  `INPUT_MODE=text` in `.env` so the terminal mode never reaches for a microphone.
- Voice can be added later — `pip install -r requirements-voice.txt` — once you attach
  a mic/speakers. XTTS runs on CPU there, so expect it to be slow.

### ✅ Done

- [x] **Minimal install runs without torch/coqui/PortAudio** — voice/ML imports are lazy
- [x] **`python app.py --web`** — headless browser UI (no display/pywebview needed)
- [x] **ARM64 / Raspberry Pi 5** — `pip install` no longer pulls Windows-only `cefpython3`
- [x] **`install.sh`** — arch/distro-aware system deps, install-profile prompt, headless detection
- [x] **`novaai/tts.py`** — Linux audio playback via ffplay, ALSA/PulseAudio/PipeWire/JACK support

### 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Fix MMD leg tracking on VRM** (foot-IK retarget) — body/arms/hands already track; legs are the open problem
- [ ] systemd service / auto-start on boot for the web UI
- [ ] Test on more distros (Fedora, Arch, NixOS)
- [ ] macOS support
